Timer System:

Users can start sessions using:

Preset durations: 15, 25, 45, 60, 90 minutes.
Free-form durations: 10 to 120 minutes.

Both types are fully equal in progression.

Session completion produces:

• A potion
• Essence
• Tag statistics
• Recipe unlock check
• Rarity roll
• Rendered asset

Session cancellation produces:

• A Muddy Brew potion

No session is ever discarded.

Tags:

Each session can have multiple tags.

Tags can be default or user-created.

Tags are not just labels — they are behavioural signals.

Tags drive:

• Focus Threads
• Habit reflection
• Weekly patterns
• Adaptive goals

Potion Creation:

Each potion stores:

• Duration
• Tags
• Completion state
• Essence earned
• Rarity
• Asset reference
• Timestamp

Once created, a potion is immutable.

Essence:

Essence is earned proportional to time.

Numbers are deliberately low to avoid grind.

Essence is used only for cosmetics and content.

Essence cannot be bought with money.

Essence exists to reinforce focus, not replace it.

Rarity Logic:

Rarity is calculated from:

• Duration
• Streak multiplier
• Recipe context
• Weighted random roll

Longer sessions increase rarity probability.

Consistency increases rarity probability.

But no session is guaranteed legendary.

Recipes:

Recipes are discoveries, not achievements.

Each recipe:

• Has a behaviour-based unlock condition
• Has lore
• Has rarity
• Unlocks one reward only

Rewards can be:

• Bottle
• Liquid colour
• Background
• Recipe scroll

Recipes are stored in the Grimoire.

Recipes are never hidden behind payment.

Failure Potions:

If a session ends early:

A Muddy Brew potion is created.

Muddy Brews:

• Have unique lore
• Have unique visual identity
• Are not counted as streak breakers by default
• Are part of the story

Focus Threads (Adaptive Goals):

Focus Threads replace quests.

They are generated weekly based on user behaviour.

Generation:

Aggregate last week’s tag totals

Identify top 3 tags

Calculate average durations

Generate goals slightly above previous behaviour

Example:

User studied 6 hours last week →
Thread: “Spend 6 hours studying this week.”

Threads feel personal.

Threads are never the same between users.

Threads are never mandatory.

Daily Threads:

Small encouragement tasks.

Weekly Threads:

Behaviour-based.

Monthly Threads:

Collection-based.

Friendship System:

Friendship is mutual.

Friends can see limited, optional information.

Friend benefits:

• Shared Essence bonus when both focus same day
• Shared recipe unlocks
• Gentle presence indicator

No competition.

No ranking.

No public numbers.

Friend recipes are special.

Friendship is always optional.

Streaks:

Streak only multiplies Essence.

Streak never removes progress.

Breaking streak has no punishment.

Retention Design:

Retention is driven by:

• Collection growth
• Lore discovery
• Rarity chase
• Seasonal content
• Friendship bonds
• Emotional memory

Not by obligation.
